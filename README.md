Project 2: Build a Data Processing Pipeline 

For this project I attached a bulk of my MA data and created an R script to recode my data in order to analyze the data through multivariate correspondence analysis. 

The correspondence analysis graphs attached demonstrate: 
Graphs 1 & 2 are the first 2 contribution plots that indicate how much variance each variable or observation contribute per component.

Graph 3 indicates the correspondence analysis for all the re coded data; points far from the origin the more distinct they probably are vs points close to the origin are probably less distinct, points within the same quadrant probably have something in common
For example: in quadrant 1 LMCI and low education seem to be similar to one another 

Graph 4 shows all individuals within the study relationships to each other

The Scree plot attached demonstrates: 
The eigenvalues of factors and is used to determine the number of factors to retain in an exploratory correspondence analysis. 
The eigenvalues here for dimension 1 = 0.1415, 16.93% varience explained and dimension 3 = 0.1207, 14.43% variance explained
